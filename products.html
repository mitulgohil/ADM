                        <h3>Halloumi</h3>
                        <p>A semi-hard chewy, white cheese originating from Cyprus and made from cow&#39;s, goat&#39;s or a
                            combination. It has a mild salty flavour and lends itself beautifully to cooking due to its firm
                            texture which is retained even when cooked and exposed to high temperatures.

                            <h4>Cook it</h4>
                            Fantastic fried, grilled or barbecued. Added to salads or served with vegetables. Halloumi is
                            often served with chopped mint to add flavour. Also goes well with finely chopped chilli.

                        <h3>Akkawi</h3>
                        <p>
                            Akkawi is from the Middle East, named after Akka, the city where it originated. The akkawi
                            in Arabic means &quot;from Akka&quot;.
                            Akkawi is commonly made with pasteurized cow&#39;s milk, but can also be made with goat or
                            sheepmilk. This cheese is largely produced in the Middle East, notably in Israel, Palestine,
                            Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and Cyprus. In these regions, people usually eat it with a soft
                            flatbread during lunch and dinner. Akkawi is hand-packed into square draining hoops and
                            then cured in a salted whey brine for two days.
                            The color is white and it has a smooth texture and a mild salty taste. It is commonly used as
                            a table cheese eaten by itself or paired with fruit.
                            The texture can be compared to Mozzarella, Feta or a Mizithra, since it does not melt easily.
                            Akkawi can be stored up to a year  The texture and flavor is a result of its specific culturing
                            from its curds that are kept together for a prolonged period longer than simpler tasting curd
                            cheese such as Syrian cheese when akkai is transformed into cheese.

                            Yogurt, yoghurt, or yoghourt (/ˈjoʊɡərt/ or /ˈjɒɡət/; from Turkish: yoğurt; other spellings
                            listed below) is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk. [1] The bacteria used to
                            make yogurt are known as &quot;yogurt cultures&quot;. Fermentation of lactose by these bacteria
                            produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic
                            tart flavor. Cow&#39;s milk is commonly available worldwide, and, as such, is the milk most
                            commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and
                            yaks is also used to produce yogurt where available locally. Milk used may be homogenized
                            or not (milk distributed in many parts of the world is homogenized); both types may be used,
                            with substantially different results.
                            Yogurt is produced using a culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and
                            Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria. In addition, other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are
                            also sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt. Some countries require yogurt to
                            contain a certain amount of colony-forming units of bacteria; in China, for example, the
                            requirement for the number of lactobacillus bacteria is at least 1 × 10 6 CFU per milliliter.
                            To produce yogurt, milk is first heated, usually to about 85 °C (185 °F), to denature the milk
                            proteins so that they do not form curds. After heating, the milk is allowed to cool to about
                            45 °C (113 °F). The bacterial culture is mixed in, and a temperature of 45 °C (113 °F) is
                            maintained for four to twelve hours to allow fermentation.
